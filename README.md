This is a machine learning model to predict the stock price of Chipotle, Inc. (CMG) for the next 30 days. 

I started this project because I'm an investor and I wanted to learn more about Machine Learning with python, so it kills two birds with one stone. My eventual goal is to create a more complete model incorporating behavioral insights like sentiment analysis and "moat size" (I know this will be hard), as well as comparing this model to the securities-ready python tools like prophet in Stocker. 

One of the biggest insights for me so far is how useful the quandl financial library is for getting stock data. I definitely plan on using it again in the future on other finance projects. 

Many internet sources were used and will be used. The list of URL's below will be continually updated as sources for the project. 

[This](https://enlight.nyc/stock-market-prediction) site was the main source of learning for this project.
